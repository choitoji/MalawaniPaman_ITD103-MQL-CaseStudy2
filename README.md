This project is called an Audio Loudness Visualizer and Monitoring System (ALVMS). This project is a potential system that can be used in monitoring and listing loudness through sound sensors connected to an Arduino LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & Mini. The loudness of the sound received by the sound sensor can be visualizaed externally and internally, by using LED lights and Database to store information and visualize the data in a web respectively.


Instructions in opening:

	-> Run the frontend in terminal using "npm run start"
	-> Run the backend in terminal using "node server.js"
	-> Run the arduino code and ensure the connection.
 	-> Change the wifi ssid, password, and ip address.
  	-> Make sure that the components are complete.
	-> Now, you can freely navigate over the site!
